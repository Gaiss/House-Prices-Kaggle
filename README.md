> My result for the predictions of the house price. You can get the same result by running my code on your own.

I've submitted my predictions on Kaggle and my score is 0.11542, ranking 471th among all the teams. See as below!(I used my roommate's Kaggle account to submit)

`If you think it helps, don't forget to star and I'll appreciate your generation!`

`If you have any good advice, please let me know to make it better. Thanks a lot~`

> P.S. It will probably take tens of minutes to run the whole code depending on your computer's performance, so please be psychologically prepared.
